# Horiseon-optimized-
An optimized patch for the Horiseon Home page for user accessibility.

# Developer Notes

This patch of the Horiseon website is meant to provide user accessibility standards to the Horiseon home page in order to provide better quality of life to the user as well as future developers.

The precious version of sourcce code provided no semantic tags for ease of navigation for other developers therfore the tags "header, section aside, and footer" have all been added in place of certain div tags.

Alt tags have also been provided in order to meet the requirement of accessibilty for all user, especially users who may have disabilities (see all image src lines).

The entire sequence has also had multiple spacings added to avoid visual clutter. (Not affecting the Home Page)

This concludes the Developer Patch notes. Thank you.
